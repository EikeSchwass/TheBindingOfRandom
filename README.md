# TheBindingOfRandom
The default randomization in The Binding of Isaac is a bit lackluster. This project aims to make the randomization more customizable.

How to use:

1. Start the Binding Of Random
  1. Disable all characters you haven't unlocked yet (or you don't own because you don't have Afterbirth)
  1. Select or unselect all characters you want to include in your randomization (for example only Eden and Isaac, or just exclude The Keeper)
  1. You can automatically let the program start the run after it selects a character or just let it make the selection and start it manually
  1. If you want to play each character of your rotation once before you play anyone again you can select "Prevent Duplicates". If you enable this feature, the program will keep track of which characters it has selected and will mark them as played until every character was played. You can toggle characters as marked played by right-clicking on their image.
  1. If you want to you can delete all "was played" marks, by clicking the "Clear play history"-button
  1. If you want to you can customize the key-combination you need to press in order to start the randomization. The default combination is Ctrl+Alt+R. To do so click on the "Change"+button and press the key you want to use. The combination will then be Ctrl+Alt+*your selected key*
2. Start the Binding of Isaac (you can start it before you make any adjustments just make sure it's started before you press your key-combination)
3. Select Isaac in the character-selection-screen (without actually starting the run of course) and press your key combination (default is Ctrl+Alt+R).
4. The program will select a character on the basis of your settings :)
